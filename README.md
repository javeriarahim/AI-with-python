# AI-with-Python
This project focuses on **Language Translation using Artificial Intelligence techniques**.  
It demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) can be applied to translate text from one language to another using Python.  
## 📖 Overview
- Uses **Python** and popular AI/NLP libraries.  
- Implements **machine translation models** (e.g., sequence-to-sequence, transformers).  
- Demonstrates training and testing with multilingual datasets.  
- Provides real-world examples of language translation.  
## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Dataset files (parallel text corpora)  
- `models/` → Trained AI/ML models for translation  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for experiments  
- `src/` → Python source code for preprocessing, training, and inference  
- `README.md` → Documentation  
## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries:  
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow torch transformers nltk
